ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rahroy82
Iâ€™m interested in Big Data and using tech stack that is used for ingestion of data, transformation of data that is being streamed or batched and making 
available for Loading to downstream applications and or datastore (data lakes, warehouse, rdbms)
Iâ€™m always learning anything that has to do with Big Data such as: 
  - advanced sql queries (postgre,mysql,oracle)
  - Nosql queries (
  - python modules
  - methods of optimizing compute nodes for distributed computing clusters
  - methods of masking data
  - data modeling
  - datastore interactive applications such as:
      - dbt
      - qlik
      - aws athena
      - aws emr
      - aws glue
      - databricks
      - spark/pyspark
  - read and write data to several datastore:
      - snowflake
      - DynamoDB
      - s3
      - Redshift
      - RDBMS
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a project that intrigues my interest. even though I mostly am into Data Engineering, I always love to learn and explore other technologies.
Depending on when you visit my github, you will see several different projects. feel free to browse and see what I have been upto I will allways have another readme to a
specific project.
